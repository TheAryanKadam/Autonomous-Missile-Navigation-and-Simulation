# Autonomous Missile Navigation System

An AI-powered simulation of an autonomous missile navigation system designed to demonstrate how **Pathfinding Algorithms** can be applied to **weapon systems** for intelligent decision-making, precision, and efficiency.


## Features
- ** Tweaked A* Pathfinding:** Terrain-aware navigation for shortest & safest routes.
- **Multi-Target Coordination:** Supports multiple simultaneous strikes.
- **Obstacle Breaching:** Simulates real-world defense evasion.
- **Real-time Simulation:** Built using **Pygame** for visualization.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Pygame (visual simulation)  
- NumPy (matrix operations)  
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning / custom agent)  
- A* Pathfinding Algorithm  

---

##  System Workflow
1. Environment with **terrain & obstacles** is generated.  
2. **Missile agent** learns navigation strategies via **RL**.  
3. **A*** algorithm ensures precise target acquisition.  
4. Simulation shows missile path, obstacles, and strikes.  


## Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autonomous-missile-navigation.git
cd autonomous-missile-navigation
pip install -r requirements.txt
python missile_terrain_2.py
